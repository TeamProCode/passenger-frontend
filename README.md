Use passenger as a personal travel blog or photo album. No need to make a scrapbook these days - use Passenger!

Passenger is an application that allows users to make an account and upoload the destinations they would like to share to the platform! When adding a destination, users are required to enter a Location, Language, Climate, Description and image. Upon submission, the new destination will populate on the page. Decide you feel differently about that place or trip? Use the Edit Destination button to change up your description or any other details! Bad memories attached to that place? Well, go ahead and delete the destination all together! You will no longer see that darned place on your screen.
